=head1 NAME

Net::Gmail::IMAP::Label - IMAP proxy for Google's Gmail that retrieves message labels

=head1 VERSION

version 0.007

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    gmail-imap-label [OPTION]...

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provides a proxy that sits between an IMAP client and Gmail's IMAPS
server and adds GMail labels to the X-Label header. This proxy uses the
L<Gmail IMAP extensions|https://developers.google.com/gmail/imap/imap-extensions#access_to_gmail_labels_x-gm-labels>.

To use this proxy, your e-mail client will need to connect to the proxy using
the IMAP protocol (without SSL).

=head1 EXAMPLES

The simplest way of starting is to run the proxy on the default port of 10143:

    gmail-imap-label

An alternative port can be specified using the B<--port> option

    gmail-imap-label --port 993

The proxy has been tested with both mutt (v1.5.21) and offlineimap (v6.3.4).
Example configuration files for these are available in the C<doc> directory.

=head1 SEE ALSO

See L<gmail-imap-label> for a complete listing of options.
